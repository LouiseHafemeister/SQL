#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.
#This data set was obtained from the Break Into Tech course

Part 1

#1 How many orders were placed in January? 9723
SELECT count(Quantity) FROM JanSales;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 379
SELECT count(Quantity) FROM JanSales WHERE Product='iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT customers.acctnum FROM customers JOIN FebSales ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? AAA Batteries for 2.99
SELECT JanSales.Product, JanSales.price FROM JanSales ORDER BY price LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue FROM JanSales GROUP BY Product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS total_quanitity, SUM(Quantity)*price AS revenue FROM FebSales WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), avg(FebSales.Quantity*FebSales.price) FROM FebSales LEFT JOIN customers 
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2;

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), location FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%' GROUP BY Product;

Part 2

#1 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE JanSales.location like '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) > 2;

#2 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February? apple airpods 1013, bose sound sport 844, wired headphones 1282
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS Quantity 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Product like '%headphone%' 
GROUP BY Product;

#3 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account.)
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum) AS Avgperaccnt
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#4 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum) AS Avgperaccnt
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id;

#5 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue 
FROM JanSales 
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity*price) desc LIMIT 1;
