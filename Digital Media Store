# For this project, I downloaded data from the Break into Tech course, it represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 
# I then performed analytics on the data using SQL to answer the provided by Break into Tech. These are the first 14 questions.
# Finally, I came up with questions of my own and again used SQL to answer them.

-- #1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- #2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- #3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceID, date(invoices.InvoiceDate) as InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry

-- #4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- #5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry 
FROM invoices;

-- #6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId

-- #8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(invoices.InvoiceId) as how_many_invoices FROM invoices WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate like '2009%';

SELECT SUM(invoices.Total) as Total FROM invoices WHERE invoices.InvoiceDate like '2009%';
  
-- #10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

-- #11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
