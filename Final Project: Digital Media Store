# For this project, I downloaded data from the Break into Tech course, it represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. 
# I then performed analytics on the data using SQL to answer the provided by Break into Tech. (#1-14)
# Finally, I came up with questions of my own and again used SQL to answer them. (#15 - 20)
