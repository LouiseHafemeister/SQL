-- US domestic flights from 1990 to 2009 Retrieved from kaggle.com 
-- Data Limitation: Each row accounts for more than one flight, there are multiple entries where the only difference is the seats, passengers, and number of flights
-- I believe each entry signifies how many flights each airline took including the total number of passengers and seats.
-- I will be focusing on the Toledo Ohio airport for the first few quieries due to it being my hometown.
